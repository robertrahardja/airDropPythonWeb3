Airdrop Trial for Ethereum

I'm trying to airdrop tokens using a local ethereum node.
So there's eventually going to be thousands given in the csv file.

All airdrop.py is doing is looping through the rows in the csv and calling the transfer function in the solidity contract

row[0] would be the addresses for tokens to be sent to
row[1] would be the amount of token to be sent

There's also a balance loop python file just to show the balances of each as time goes by.



Any comments are welcome as this would eventually require real money :)
