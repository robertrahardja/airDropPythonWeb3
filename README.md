Airdrop Trial for Ethereum

I'm trying to airdrop tokens using a local ethereum node.
So there's going to be thousands given in the csv file. There's only two here

All airdrop.py is doing is looping through the rows in the csv and calling the transfer function in the solidity contract

row[0] would be the addresses for tokens to be sent to
row[1] would be the amount of token to be sent

Any comments are welcome as this would eventually require real money :)
